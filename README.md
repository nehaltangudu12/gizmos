Various gizmos and small projects I have made while learning web development.

These include:
  - IQ Generator (Just a random number generator)
  - Background Color Changer
  - Random Wikipedia Article Finder
  - **Online Basic HTML/CSS Editor**
    - HTML/CSS output generated in the browser
    - Automatically updates as you type.
